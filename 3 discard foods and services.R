# # DESCRIPTION --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
#       DISCARDING FOODS AND SERVICES FROM THE DATA FRAME CONTAINING ALL ORDERS MADE AT THE CAFE     
#
# At this point, all useful data has been extracted from the raw data generated by the cash register.
# Now, it's time to start chipping away at this data and remove irrelevant data.
#
# The challenge here is that the data contains information on food and services ordered at the cafe.
# It is irrelevant to the analysis, which will concern drink items only.
#
# The first script generated a reference table with all unique menu items and menu item modifiers.
# This table was manually edited to discriminate between items and modifiers because their IDs were
# double-booked.
#
# The second script generated a table with all orders made in the cafe. The content of each order is
# in a string where menu items and modifiers are separated by "{" symbol.
#
# This third script in the project takes in the latter table and gets rid of menu items and modifiers 
# that are not drink-related using the former reference table. 
#            ~ ~ ~

# # FUNCTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
# (1) is.drink is fed a short string "[[:digit:]]+,item/mod name". Using the "," separator,
#     the function breaks this string up into two elements: item ID and item description.
#     These two elements are then looked up in a reference table.
#
#     is.drink returns TRUE if the item it was fed is in fact a drink item that should be kept.
#     This function will be used via the apply family in the next function, dropNonDrinks.

is.drink <- function(Item) {
  
  Item <- unlist(strsplit(Item, ","))
  
  # The row of the  relevant menu item/mod is the row where locations of ID and Description intersect.
  # While it's possible to use regex here ("^Item$"), the data's already been wrangled, so a simple
  # logical comparison will suffice--and it works faster, too:
  
  referenceRow <- intersect( which(Item[1] == referenceTable$ID),
                             which(Item[2] == referenceTable$Description) )
  
  # Wrapping the condition in some null-checks to avoid nasty errors:
  
  if (!is.null(referenceRow) || referenceRow>0) 
    {
    
      # The function checks if the matched row in the reference table's column with item types 
      # indicates that this item is indeed a drink, and not food or service:
    
      if (referenceTable[referenceRow, 5] == "drink") { return(TRUE) } else { return(FALSE) }
    
    } else { return(FALSE) }
  
}
#   ~ ~ ~ ~

# (2) dropNonDrinks is fed a string from orderContents. For example:
#         "54,Gateau{3,Latte 8oz{4,Lait ordinaire{3,Latte 8oz{4,Lait ordinaire"
#
#     The function breaks this string up into a vector of strings "[[:digit:]]+,item/mod name" 
#     using the "{" separator. After is.drink is applied to each element, 
#     only those that return TRUE are kept. 
#
#     dropNonDrinks returns an edited string. The function is used via the apply family on the column 
#     containing order contents from the data frame with all orders, allOrders$orderContents.

dropNonDrinks <- function(orderString) {
  
  # print(orderString) # Printing the input for debugging purposes.
  
  Items <- unlist(strsplit(orderString, "\\{"))
  
  keep <- sapply(Items, is.drink)
  
  outputString <- paste0(Items[keep], "{", collapse='')
  
  # Dropping the unnecessary last "{" separator at end of string:
  
  outputString <- gsub("\\{$", "", outputString)
  
  return(outputString)
